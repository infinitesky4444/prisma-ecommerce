### Manage your products, your orders, your customers.

# Philosophy

You'll quickly realize that there are no state-management library whatsoever. I'm actively militating against the wrong usage of those. Although a sweet Redux or MobX could have been used in some places (especially on the RN app), this app also acts as a showcase to promote vanilla React. Especially since the new Context API (Although I haven't updated React yet).
